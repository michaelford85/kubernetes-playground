## Why obtain a Certification?

In my personal journey to brand myself as a specialist in cloud-native technologies, I've found industry standard certifications to serve two purposes (that would apply to most people). First, it's a way of gauging one's level of k8s knowledge against a standardized benchmark; passing the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam lets me know I've achieved a defined level of expertise. Secondly, having an industry standard certification provides a level of credibility with my customers and colleagues before I open my mouth. Both of these objectives can be achieved without the expense/time of a postgraduate University program, and with minimal cost - you might pay for a subscription to a self-paced learning resource, minimal cloud costs for access to a k8s cluster, or a relatively small up front cost for a local k8s/k3s cluster).


## Certification Study Resources

These are the resources I recommend for preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer Exam:

### KodeKloud
